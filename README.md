# Eventdim

Eventdim is an event management site that allows users to browse and create local events. Based on the live Eventbrite site, Eventdim focuses on events based in Sacramento while provides a simple interface centered around a grid layout on the homepage. Paralleling a virtual poster board, Eventdim seeks to serve as an easily navigable app while promoting community and involvement within the Sacramento region.


The live site can be found
